## ComfyUI-AllergicPack
This package is not ready for primetime but I'm making it public anyway.  If I'm using the node then I'm putting it here.  Might make it more official later.  Use at your own risk.

## Installation
Clone to "custom_nodes"

```
git clone https://github.com/usrname0/ComfyUI-AllergicPack.git
```

## FileCounter-Folder
Indiscriminately counts files in a folder and displays it on the node itself (by INT out).
